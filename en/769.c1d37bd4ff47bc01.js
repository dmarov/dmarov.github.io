Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is an effective method to help accomplish this goal. In contrast to forced unit testing, where tests are written after the fact in order to test existing code, BDD advocates writing tests before implementation. This approach leads to better code design and ensures that testing focuses on behavior rather than code itself. Writing tests after the fact typically results in low-quality tests and suboptimal code design. Test-Driven Development (TDD) is also a valuable methodology, but it can be misinterpreted as implying that development is a purely mechanical process when it's not ",M=" I consider that it's worth following SOLID principles. The most important ones are \"Single Responsibility\" and \"Open-Closed\" principles, as well as encapsulation. Quality code \"does one thing well\" ",O=" I consider that the usefulness of inheritance is often overrated. It is appropriate in some cases, but most of the time, object composition is preferable. The main downside of inheritance is that it creates tight coupling to the parent class ",f=" I consider the most elegant solution is the simplest one. There's not much we can do with essential complexity, but reducing accidental complexity is a job that has to be done well. Polymorphism is one of the most useful tools for decreasing complexity ",p=" I consider that refactoring should be regarded as part of a task rather than a separate process ",P=" I consider the ability to ask correct questions is the most valuable skill a developer can have ",S=" I consider that every significant consideration ought to be based on valid argumentation to be accepted ",C=" I am a strong advocate for uniform code formatting, because it reduces distractions and helps us focus on what's essential, which is software architecture ",I=" I am a strong advocate for fast code integration methods like trunk-based development, as it significantly reduces bugs caused by intricate conflicts ",h=" I consider it's important to progress with small steps and obtain fast feedback from users at the end of each step in order to avoid wasting time and money on features that users do not need ",m=" I consider the importance of appropriate naming to be significantly underrated in general.
